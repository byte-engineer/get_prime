# primes.py
The idea of the code is to try every single number to see if it is divisible by all the numbers less than it.
Then the code requests a number from the user to determine the range. The range always starts from zero all the way to the limit that the user determines previously.

# sort.py
This code accepts a list containing numbers to sort it.
The main idea is to divide the list into pairs and compare these pairs. We actually do that a couple of times. According to the results, we sort the list.
